This is a simple ATM system implemented in C, which allows the user to perform the following operations:

Check Balance: Displays the current balance of the account.
Withdraw Money: Allows the user to withdraw money if the balance is sufficient.
Deposit Money: Allows the user to deposit money into the account.
Mini Statement: Shows a mini statement of all the transactions (deposits and withdrawals).
Exit: Exits the program.
The program uses file handling to store the balance in a file (balance.dat) and maintains a transaction log (mini.dat) for mini statements. It also includes basic PIN-based authentication for security.
